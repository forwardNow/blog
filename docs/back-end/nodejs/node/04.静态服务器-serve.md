# 静态服务器 —— serve

## 介绍

serve helps you serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network). 
It also provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents:

## 安装

```shell
npm install --global serve
```

## 使用

```shell
#  you can run this command inside your project's directory...
serve

# specify which folder you want to serve:
serve folder-name/

# run this command to see a list of all available options:
serve --help
```
